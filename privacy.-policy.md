Privacy Policy for Chords&Frets:
 
This application does not require, collect, or use any data. The google play store may use or collect data though.

The application will save chords to a file however this is all done locally.

Google Data:
It seems that some data is automatically collected by google play including visitors of the store page, install numbers, country and acquisition channel of install/visit, ratings, and the type of device giving the rating.
All of this data will only be view privately by me apart from the install numbers which I may use in resumes or portfolios.
