# Chords-Frets
The repo for the mobile app Chords&amp;Frets


Fretter & Chords

This app display a guitar neck and then provides chords or other finger placements to help you practice playing the guitar.


ISSUES:<br />
-Many phones are smaller than the neck of a guitar.<br />
-The placements are based upon the size of the phone / user preference, not the size of an actual guitar.<br />
-There is a minimum limit to the distance between touches for it to be counted as two different presses. In other words when you try to press two buttons right next to each other it may not work.<br />
-Might not be intuitive that adding chords can work on different sizes.<br />
<br />	
<br />
TODO: (hopefully / if I feel like it)<br />
-Allow for chords / finger placements to be queued instead of random, so chord progressions / songs can be played.<br />
-Allow for tab or other song data input.<br />
-Allow for resizing the guitar size.<br />
-Allow for resizing the guitar size to make it bigger, which may be helpful in some way.<br />
-Save the settings<br />
-Put all the string in the guitar view into the strings resource file.<br />
-Allow for several files which chords can be saved to, and allow for the user to choose which to save to and which to open.<br />
-Do something about strumming, maybe, probably not. (It's a very long term goal)<br />

BUGS: ()<br />
-On edit stream - When you are holding down on the screen you can't interact with other touch things<br />
